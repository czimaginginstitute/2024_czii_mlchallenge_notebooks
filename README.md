# 2024 CZ CryoET ML Challenge

This repository contains notebooks to facilitate entries in the CZ CryoET ML Challenge. These notebooks are organized as follows:

- overview.ipynb: how to use, visualize, process, and sample the cryoET datasets
- 3D U-Net: training and inference notebooks using a 3D UNet with MONAI and PyTorch
- DeepFindET: training and inference using a Tensorflow-based 3D UNet
- tomotwin: training and inference using a PyTorch-based ResNet with pretrained models
